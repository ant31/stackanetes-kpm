# Stackanetes

Stackanetes is an initiative to make operating OpenStack as simple as running any application on Kubernetes.
Stackanetes deploys standard OpenStack services into containers and uses Kubernetesâ€™ robust application lifecycle management capabilities to deliver a single platform for companies to run OpenStack Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) and container workloads.

## Overview

### Services

Stackanetes sets up the following OpenStack components:
- Cinder (with external Ceph storage)
- Glance (with external Ceph storage or local filesystem)
- Horizon
- Keystone
- Neutron + Open vSwitch
- Nova

In addition to these, a few other applications are deployed:
- MariaDB
- Memcached
- RabbitMQ
- RADOS Gateway
- Traefik

Services are divided and scheduled into two groups, except from few services that run everywhere (e.g. Open vSwitch agents, Traefik):
- The control plane, which runs all the OpenStack APIs and every other supporting applications,
- The compute plane, which is dedicated to run Nova's virtual machines.

### Requirements

For Stackanetes to run, there is a single requirement:
- Kubernetes 1.3+
  - Two nodes available for scheduling,
  - Virtualization support for compute nodes,
  - Kubelet running with `--allow-privileged=true`,
  - Network connectivity between the containers across nodes (e.g. flanneld),
  - DNS add-on.

To deploy Stackanetes, a container runtime is needed (e.g. rkt).

### High-availability & Networking

Thanks to Kubernetes' [deployments](http://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/deployments/), common OpenStack APIs can be made highly-available using a single parameter, called `replicas`.

Internal traffic (i.e. inside the Kubernetes cluster) is load-balanced natively using Kubernetes' [services](http://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/services/). When Ingress is enabled, external access (i.e. from outside of the Kubernetes cluster), can be done and guaranteed using a simple Round-Robin DNS pointing to every nodes exposing Traefik (i.e. every nodes labeled to deploy Stackanetes). Traefik will then forward requests through the Kubernetes load-balancing mechanism, which has awareness of each service health.

If Ceph is enabled, data availability for Cinder and Glance is assured by the storage backend itself.

## Getting started

### Customize

    TODO

### Deploy

First of all, at least two nodes must be labelled for Stackanetes' usage:

    kubectl label node minion1 openstack-control-plane=enabled
    kubectl label node minion2 openstack-compute-node=enabled

If Ingress is enabled (default), the DNS environment should be configured to resolve the following names (modulo a custom Ingress host that may have been configured) to the nodes that have been labeled:

    identity.openstack.cluster
    horizon.openstack.cluster
    image.openstack.cluster
    network.openstack.cluster
    volume.openstack.cluster
    compute.openstack.cluster
    novnc.compute.openstack.cluster

Then,

    TODO

### Access

Once Stackanetes is entirely deployed, we can log in to Horizon or use the CLI directly.

If Ingress is enabled, Horizon may be accessed on http://horizon.openstack.cluster:30080/. Otherwise, it will be available on port 80 of any defined external IP. The default credentials are _admin_ / _password_.

The file [env_openstack.sh](env_openstack.sh) contains the default environment variables required to interact with OpenStack using the `openstack` client.

### Update

    TODO

## Limitations

Some features haven't been implemented yet in Stackanetes:
- MariaDB, Memcached, RabbitMQ are not deployed in a highly-available manner,
- Some OpenStack features are missing (see components list above),
- Compute services can't be ran using the rkt container runtime,
- SSL/TLS is not terminated.
